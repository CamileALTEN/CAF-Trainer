# Security Design

This document describes how security concerns are integrated into the project.

## Architecture

The application is split into a **backend** (Node.js/Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL) and a **frontend** (React). Authentication is based on JWT.

Secrets are loaded from environment variables using `dotenv` and validated on startup.

## Security Principles

- **Security by Design**: the code applies `helmet` for secure HTTP headers and enforces HTTPS when certificates are provided.
- **Least Privilege**: API routes use an authentication middleware that verifies the user role before granting access.
- **Secret Management**: critical secrets (`JWT_SECRET`, `DATA_KEY`, SMTP credentials) are not stored in the repository and must be provided via environment variables.
- **Logging and Audit**: a winston based logger records HTTP requests and errors to a log file.
- **Revocation**: JWT tokens include a `tokenVersion` checked against the database to allow revocation.

## Dependency Management

The project relies on thirdâ€‘party packages that must be kept up to date to
avoid known vulnerabilities. Updates are tracked automatically by GitHub
Dependabot for all workspaces and GitHub Actions. Every pull request triggers a
`npm audit` workflow which fails the build if high or critical issues are
reported. A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) can be generated with
`npm run generate:sbom` to inventory components. Dependencies should be reviewed
weekly and updated promptly when security patches are released.

## Validation

This document is intended for peer or security expert review to validate the overall design and proposed protections.

## Software and Data Integrity

To address OWASP A08 risks:

- Dependencies are locked with `package-lock.json` and verified by the CI workflow running `npm audit`.
- Dockerfiles check the SHA-256 hash of the internal certificate before adding it to the trust store.
- Any future resources loaded from a CDN must include a Subresource Integrity (`integrity`) attribute, for example:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/lib.js"
        integrity="sha384-..."
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
- External artifacts such as scripts or archives must have their hash validated before use.
